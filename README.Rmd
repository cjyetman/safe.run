# safe.run

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of safe.run is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of safe.run from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("safe.run")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maurolepore/safe.run")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(safe.run)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!




# FIXME integrate text into skeleton above

# safe.run

no, so here’s the deal…. when you select multiple lines of commands in the editor of RStudio and click command-return (or whatever that is on Windows), it will essentially paste each line of the selected text into the console and run them sequentially. The problem with that is… if one of the command fails or errors, RStudio doesn’t care and then it will continue copy-pasting-running all the lines after that. Often, that’s not a big deal, but…. often (especially with not very cautious R users) it means that a bunch of lines of code that shouldn’t run, do run… and the result of that can be…
They start looking for the problem from the bottom of the console starting with the last error instead of the first error (I know, they shouldn’t, but they do… even I do it when I’m being sloppy, especially when it’s a lot of output). That leads to users wondering why a particular function failed and believing that something is wrong with one of the last lines in the code chunk they ran, and they start messing with how those commands are written, when in reality they simply failed because some object or setting that was not set properly in one of the lines before it didn’t get set properly because a previous command failed.
Sometimes, that can lead to the environment filling up with a bunch of objects that are improperly specified.
and worst, if there’s a command in there that is “expensive” (time, over-writing files, etc.), it will run even if the setup for it above failed
for instance…
x <- 2
stopifnot(x == 1)
message("the next command will take a long time, but is only relevant if x==1")
Sys.sleep(10)
message("finished!!!")
if you select all of those lines and click command-return, they will all run, you’ll get the error and the message, but then it will continue and run the rest anyway. It’s an absurd, but very simple example. Imagine the Sys.sleep(10) command actually ran a time-consuming process that would overwrite a bunch of important output files.
There’s a simple way of getting around that… something that I used to do manually all the time… wrap the code chunk in { } so it runs as a function. So that’s all this thing would do… take whatever is selected as a string, prepend a { to the beginning, append a } to the end, and then send the whole chunk at once to the console.
So now, save this function into your environment…
# Safe Execute Current Selection
safe_execute <-
  function() {
    context <- rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()
    command <- paste0('{\n', context$selection[[1]]$text, '\n}')
    rstudioapi::sendToConsole(command)
  }
then select the original code chunk im your editor again, and this time run safe_execute() in the console.
So the idea is to simply wrap that into a R package that registers this function as an addin, and then suggest to the users to remap the default key command command-return to the addin’s safe_excute function.
